\PropositionE{1}
{The world is everything that is the case.\footnote{The decimal figures as numbers of the separate propositions indicate the logical
importance of the propositions, the emphasis laid upon them in my exposition.
The propositions \textit{n}.1, \textit{n}.2, \textit{n}.3, etc., are comments on proposition No.\;\textit{n}; the propositions
\textit{n}.\textit{m}1, \textit{n}.\textit{m}2, etc., are comments on the proposition No.\;\textit{n}.\textit{m}; and so on.}}


\PropositionE{1.1}
{The world is the totality of facts, not of
things.}


\PropositionE{1.11}
{The world is determined by the facts, and by
these being \emph{all} the facts.}


\PropositionE{1.12}
{For the totality of facts determines both what is
the case, and also all that is not the case.}


\PropositionE{1.13}
{The facts in logical space are the world.}


\PropositionE{1.2}
{The world divides into facts.}


\PropositionE{1.21}
{Any one can either be the case or not be the
case, and everything else remain the same.}
