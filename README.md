# Tractatus

### About
An interactive visualisation of Wittgenstein's philosophical classic, the *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*. The text exhibits a tree-structure of comments upon comments, which I bring out here visually and allow to be read in the intended order. The front is done in React. The back parses the open source .tex document into JSON and offers it through an API, all in node.
